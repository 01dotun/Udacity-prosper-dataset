The Prosper loan dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan. During the wrangling andexploratory phase of the dataset, I removed columns that were not necessary for my analysis, I also changed some columns types as required and made the variables IncomeRange, EmploymentStatus, and LoanStatus ordered categorical data types.
